This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to run a Python script that connects to a SQL Server database, reads data from a table, inserts new data, and prints the updated table. 

The script uses `pyodbc`, a Python library that facilitates connections to ODBC databases.

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.6 or above installed. If you do not have Python installed, you can download it from the official site - https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. SQL Server Database: You should have a SQL Server database set up with the appropriate permissions to read and write data.

3. pyodbc module: The pyodbc module should be installed on your system. If it's not, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pyodbc
```
